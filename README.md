# ReactJs Practice - `react-3` Branch

This branch (`react-3`) of the **ReactJs-practice** repository contains code exercises and examples focused on key React concepts such as **conditional rendering**, **array mapping**, and other foundational practices. These examples help strengthen your understanding of React and how to render components dynamically.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Conditional Rendering
- Render UI elements based on conditions (booleans, expressions).
- Use of ternary operators and logical `&&` for cleaner JSX.
- Toggling between components.

### 2. Array Mapping and Lists
- Use of the `map()` function to render dynamic lists.
- Handling unique keys for list elements.
- Gracefully handling empty or undefined arrays.

### 3. Additional Practices
- Passing props for reusable components.
