# ReactJs Practice - (Branch: react-5)

This branch is dedicated to practicing **React State Management** using the **useState hook**, which is fundamental for building dynamic, interactive React applications.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast, modern development tool for React apps.

## Concepts Covered

### 1. React State
In this branch, you will find:
- How to initialize and manage component-level state using the `useState` hook.
- How state changes can trigger re-renders in React.
- Best practices for working with state in functional components.

### 2. useState Hook
This branch focuses on:
- **Initializing State**: Setting initial state values.
- **Updating State**: Updating state in response to user actions or events.
- **State as Objects**: Managing complex state as objects and arrays.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Dynamically rendering components based on the state.

## Project Setup

The project uses **Vite** as the build tool for fast development and easy setup.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nikhilkhandelwal006/ReactJs-practice.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ReactJs-practice
    ```

3. Checkout the `react-5` branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout react-5
    ```

4. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Project

Start the development server using Vite:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app should now be running at `localhost:3000`.

### Building the Project
To build the project for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
